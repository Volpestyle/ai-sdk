### Research SDK Implementation (GPT Pro)
Result: [[README|AI SDK component specs]]
im developing a ai-sdk, which is a suite of packages and tools for AI powered applications. Think AI model pipelines and constructs that can potentially be mixed and matched.

for example, we have this product spec for an app:
[[product_spec]]

and take this other high level spec idea:
[[Personastu]]

These are two apps which could use many of the same components!
We've done a break down analysis of what such components could be here:
[[components]]

-------------------

Can you do some research on what specific local and/or provider models we can utilize for each of these components? Concretely sketch out implementation details for each of these SDK components, filling in any gaps or making any modifications to the components we've outlined above. We're focused on getting to the end product, and breaking it down into manageable, reconfigurable and rearrangeable pieces.

Then create a .zip with a concrete product spec and tech spec for each of these components you've decided to go with, include .mmd files, and we'll embed png output of these into the docs.
